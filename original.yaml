                          cluster. Typically this is accomplished through creating

                          to direct traffic to 'solver pods', which are responsible
                          for responding to the ACME server's HTTP requests.

                                        etc. The handler is not called if the container
                                        crashes or exits. The reason for termination
                                        is passed to the handler. The Pod''s termination
                                        grace period countdown begins before the PreStop
                                        hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome
                                        of the handler, the container will eventually
                                        terminate within the Pod''s termination grace
                                        period. Other management of the container
                                        blocks until the hook completes or until the
                                        termination grace period is reached. More

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set

                                    satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number

    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
